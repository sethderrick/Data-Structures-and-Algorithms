    If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree: BFS

    If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: BFS (DFS will take long)

    If the tree is very wide: DFS (BFS will need too much memory)

    If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree: DFS

    Determining whether a path exists between two nodes: DFS

    Finding the shortest path: BFS
