# Implementation of Data Structures and Algorithms with Rust

## Overview -

This is an un-optimized first swipe at translating the JavaScript examples from a recent courseware to Rust.

### Data Structures -

1. Arrays
2. Graphs
3. Hashtables (dictionary)
4. Linked Lists
5. Stack and Queues

### Algorithms -

1. Dynamic Programming
2. Recursion
3. Sorting
4. Traversals
   - BFS
   - DFS
