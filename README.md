# Implementation of Data Structures and Algorithms with Rust

## Overview -

~~This is an un-optimized, first swipe at translating to Rust the JavaScript examples from a recent courseware at Zero To Mastery.~~
I'm currently going through and editing all the examples and making sure they can be compiled. I'm taking care to adhere, as much as 
possible, to the originals but I want everything to compile. 
Original examples are to be found at: https://github.com/aneagoie/ztm-master-the-coding-interview-ds-algo.git

Please feel free to submit pull requests or contact me directly via email for suggested improvements and fixes.
