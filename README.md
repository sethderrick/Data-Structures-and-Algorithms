# Implementation of Data Structures and Algorithms with Rust

## Overview -

~~This is an un-optimized, first swipe at translating to Rust the JavaScript examples from a recent courseware at Zero To Mastery.~~
~~I'm currently going through and editing all the examples and making sure they can be compiled. I'm taking care to adhere, as much as
possible, to the originals but I want everything to compile.~~
All that can compile now do compile!!
Original examples are to be found at: https://github.com/aneagoie/ztm-master-the-coding-interview-ds-algo.git
