# Implementation of Data Structures and Algorithms with Rust

## Overview -

This is an un-optimized first swipe at translating the JavaScript examples from a recent courseware to Rust.
Original examples are to be found at: https://github.com/aneagoie/ztm-master-the-coding-interview-ds-algo.git

The directory 00_bigO is not yet translated to Rust but I'm working on it!
